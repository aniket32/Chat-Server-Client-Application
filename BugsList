This is a list to represent all errors/bugs our code has:
- Doing Quit command causes server to stop accepting connections ;
- Kicking a user causes server to stop accepting connections ;
(attempted fix, removed socket.close statements from server)

- Server will print several connected statements when one user connects (depends how many connections there are);
- Client sometimes loses connection randomly,
-
