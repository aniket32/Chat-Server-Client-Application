This is a list to represent all errors/bugs our code has:
- Doing Quit command causes server to stop accepting connections - Fixed;
- Kicking a user causes server to stop accepting connections - Fixed;
(removed socket.close statements from server)

- Server will print several connected statements when one user connects (depends how many connections there are);
- Client sometimes loses connection randomly - Fixed;
- Shows random clients that are disconnected still connected - Fixed;
- WorkerList Is bugged (ConcurrentModificationException);
- Spam Protection(if we want)
- AFK needs to be Completed
