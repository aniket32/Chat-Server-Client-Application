This is a list to represent all errors/bugs our code has:
- Doing Quit command causes server to stop accepting connections - Fixed;
- Kicking a user causes server to stop accepting connections - Fixed;
(removed socket.close statements from server)

- Server will print several connected statements when one user connects (depends how many connections there are);
- Client sometimes loses connection randomly,
- Shows random clients that are disconnected still connected
- WorkerList Is bugged
